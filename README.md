# blender-dalton-contrast-objects
Inspired by my colorblind uncle, this plugin helps differentiate nearby objects in Blender. It automatically assigns high-contrast colors based on object proximity/position (X-axis) without affecting your materials. Supports Deutan, Protan, Tritan, and Mono. Real, non-destructive accessibility.
